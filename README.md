## Abstract:
The study of excitation dynamics in various networks using continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of quantum computing and quantum information science. This project focuses on simulating CTQWs on quantum computers, with a particular emphasis on excitation transfer and Anderson localization. We explore strategies to enhance excitation transfer in graphs that do not naturally exhibit perfect state transfer (PST) by adding internal connections or introducing disorder into the system's Hamiltonian. Additionally, we investigate the disrupting effects of disorder on excitation transfer and the phenomenon of Anderson localization in CTQWs. Using variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) or internal connections in graphs, we were able to simulate and observe enhanced excitation transfer in graphs.
